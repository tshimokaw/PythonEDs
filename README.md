# Lanczos-based methods for S=1/2 XXZ model
Here is a webpage for the exact diagonalization (ED) tutorial lecture in "[**APCTP-IACS-SNBNCBS WORKSHOP ON COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR EMERGENT QUANTUM MATTER:
FROM THEORETICAL CONCEPTS TO EXPERIMENTAL REALIZATION**](https://www.bose.res.in/Conferences/APCTP22/program/index.html)".

The goal of this tutorial is to understand the principles of the three Lanczos-based methods, Lanczos, Finite-Temperature Lanczos, and continued fraction methods. These methods are important and fundamental to investigate the ground-state, finite-temperature physics, and spin dynamics from finite-size clusters of quantum frustrated magnets. We here focus on an S=1/2 XXZ spin model for simplicity. We will also learn how to make S=1/2 ED codes with bit representations and bitwise operations, which are efficient for fast ED codes, and will learn the simplest block diagonalization technique under conserved magnetization via Python ED sample codes.
